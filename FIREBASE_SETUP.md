# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## The 400 Error Fix

The 400 error during account creation typically means **Email/Password authentication is not enabled** in your Firebase project. Follow these steps to fix it:

## üî• Firebase Console Setup

### Step 1: Enable Authentication
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **spinwebsite-88e4b**
3. Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Get Started** if you haven't set up Authentication yet

### Step 2: Enable Email/Password Provider
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Sign-in method** tab
2. Click on **Email/Password** provider
3. **Enable** the first toggle (Email/Password)
4. **Save** the changes

### Step 3: Configure Authorized Domains (if needed)
1. Still in **Sign-in method** tab
2. Scroll down to **Authorized domains**
3. Make sure these domains are listed:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `spinwebsite-88e4b.firebaseapp.com` (your Firebase hosting domain)
   - Your custom domain if you have one

### Step 4: Set Up Security Rules (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
2. Update rules to allow authenticated users:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
